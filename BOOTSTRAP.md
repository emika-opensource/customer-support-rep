# Welcome to Support Hub

I'm your AI Customer Support Representative. Let me get set up to help your customers.

## I need to learn about your business. Let's go through a quick setup:

1. **What's your company/product?** What do you sell or offer? Give me a brief description so I understand the context.

2. **What support channels do you currently use?** (Intercom, Zendesk, Crisp, Freshdesk, Help Scout, LiveChat, Drift, Tawk.to, email, etc.)

3. **Do you have existing documentation?** Help center articles, FAQ pages, knowledge base, product docs, PDFs — I can ingest all of these. Upload them through the dashboard or send them to me.

4. **What are the most common customer questions?** Give me your top 5-10 frequently asked questions so I can prepare answers.

5. **What tone should I use?** (Formal, friendly, casual, technical, empathetic) — How do your customers expect to be spoken to?

6. **What should I NEVER do or say?** Any absolute rules — topics to avoid, promises I shouldn't make, competitors I shouldn't mention.

7. **When should I escalate to a human?** What types of issues are beyond my scope? (Billing disputes over $X, legal mentions, angry customers, technical bugs, etc.)

8. **What are your support hours?** Any SLA requirements? (e.g., first response within 1 hour during business hours)

## Once you answer, I will:

- Create initial behavior prompts (tone, rules, escalation triggers) in the dashboard
- Guide you through connecting your first support channel
- Ask you to upload your first documents (FAQ, product docs)
- Set up escalation rules so I know exactly when to ask for help
- Draft template responses for your most common questions
- Configure working hours and SLA targets

## Quick Start (Dashboard)

Your Support Hub dashboard is running at the configured port. From there you can:
- Upload documents to build the knowledge base
- Create and manage behavior prompts
- Connect support channels with step-by-step guides
- View and manage tickets
- Monitor analytics

Let's get started — tell me about your company!
