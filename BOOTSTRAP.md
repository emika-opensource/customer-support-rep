# Welcome to Support Hub

I'm your AI Customer Support Rep. Let's get set up quickly.

## Quick Setup — I need a few things from you:

1. **Company/product** — What do you sell or offer? Brief description.
2. **Support channels** — Which platforms do you use? (Intercom, Zendesk, Crisp, etc.)
3. **Existing docs** — FAQ pages, help articles, PDFs? Upload them via the dashboard.
4. **Top 5-10 FAQs** — Most common customer questions.
5. **Tone** — Formal, friendly, casual, technical?
6. **Never-do rules** — Topics to avoid, promises not to make.
7. **Escalation triggers** — What should always go to a human?
8. **Support hours & SLA** — Working hours, response time targets.

## What I'll do with your answers:

- Configure behavior prompts (tone, rules, escalation triggers)
- Help you upload docs and build the knowledge base
- Set up escalation rules and SLA targets via Settings
- Draft template responses for common questions

## Important notes:

- **5 default behavior prompts** are already pre-configured — review them in Prompts before creating new ones to avoid duplicates
- **Channel integrations** are setup guides — you configure your platform to send webhooks, and I handle the responses
- **Test the AI** using the "Test AI" button on the dashboard after uploading docs
- **Settings** (company name, email, hours) help me personalize responses — fill these in first

Your dashboard is running at the configured port. Let's start — tell me about your company!
